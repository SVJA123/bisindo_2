## Components

The repository structure is organized as follows:

- **`data`**: Contains images used for training the model.
- **`data_add`**: Contains images used for validating the model.
- **`dataset_collection`**: Provides details on the data collection process.
- **`model`**: Includes code to train a model using only hand landmarks as input.
- **`model_angles`**: Extends the model with calculated angles as additional input features alongside hand landmarks.
- **`model_hybrid`**: Contains the primary hybrid model combining both angles and hand landmarks, used throughout this project.
- **`validation`**: Contains scripts to evaluate model performance, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
- **`verification`**: Includes scripts to run real-time model tests locally using your deviceâ€™s webcam.
- **`conversion.py`**: Script to convert the trained Keras model into TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) format for deployment within the mobile application.
